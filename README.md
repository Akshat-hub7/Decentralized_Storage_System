# Decentralized_Storage_System

Project Description

Our decentralized storage system leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure, efficient, and trustless platform for storing and accessing data. Designed to eliminate the vulnerabilities and centralization risks associated with traditional cloud storage providers, this system ensures data integrity, privacy, and reliability.

Key Features:
Decentralization: Files are distributed across a global network of nodes, ensuring no single point of failure.
Security: Data is encrypted end-to-end, ensuring only authorized users have access.
Cost-Effectiveness: By utilizing spare storage on decentralized nodes, we lower costs compared to traditional providers.
Immutability: Using blockchain technology, file metadata is permanently recorded, ensuring transparency and traceability.
User Ownership: Users maintain full control of their data, with no reliance on centralized authorities.
Use Cases:
Personal data storage for individuals seeking greater privacy and security.
Business applications requiring tamper-proof records and scalable storage solutions.
Backup systems resistant to outages or cyberattacks.
Hosting content in censorship-resistant environments.
This project aims to redefine how data is stored and accessed, empowering users with trustless technology that aligns with Web3 principles. By integrating with blockchain ecosystems like Telos EVM or others, it facilitates interoperability and smart contract integration for enhanced utility.
